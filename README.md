# Digital-Design-Verification

Welcome to my **Digital Design & Verification repository**, where I document my journey of writing RTL, verifying designs, and building a strong foundation for a **Design Verification Engineer role**.

# About This Repository

This repository demonstrates my **structured, verification-oriented approach** to digital design:

- Implemented **synthesizable Verilog RTL** for combinational and sequential circuits.
- Verified each design with **SystemVerilog testbenches**, applying exhaustive and random stimulus.
- Captured **waveforms** to visualize behavior and validate timing.
- Maintained **daily notes** on learnings, assertions, and corner-case testing.
- This journey reflects **consistent practice**, showing discipline and deep understanding of design verification.
- 
 **"Consistency is the bridge between learning and mastery. Each block here is verified, documented, and ready for real-world verification workflows."**
  
# Learning & Verification Approach

1. **Understand the Digital Design Concept**  
   Focused on both combinational and sequential circuits.

2. **Write Synthesizable RTL in Verilog**  
   Every block is designed with industry-style RTL practices.

3. **Create SystemVerilog Testbenches**  
   - Exhaustive stimulus  
   - Self-checking assertions  
   - Random and edge-case inputs

4. **Observe & Document Behavior**  
   - Waveforms captured via simulator  
   - Notes on corner cases, verification strategy, and lessons learned

5. **Maintain Daily Consistency**   
   - Every day adds one or more designs  
   - Demonstrates **discipline, learning maturity, and verification mindset**

# Tools Used

- **Verilog & SystemVerilog** – RTL & testbench  
- **Icarus Verilog** – Compilation & simulation  
- **GTKWave** – Waveform visualization  
- **Python / Perl** – Future supporting utilities for log parsing & stimulus generation

# Highlights

- **Combinational Circuits** – AND, OR, XOR, NAND, NOR, XNOR, MUX, Decoder, Encoder, Adder  
- **Sequential Circuits** – Flip-Flops (D, JK), Counters, Shift Registers, FSMs  
- **Verification Mindset** – Assertions, corner cases, exhaustive & random stimulus  
- **Waveform Visualization** – Screenshots attached per design block  
- **Daily Consistency** – Each block verified & documented, demonstrating systematic growth

# How to Navigate

1. Open the **combinational/** or **sequential/** folders.  
2. Each design block folder contains:
   - `rtl/` → Verilog design  
   - `tb/` → SystemVerilog testbench  
   - `waveforms/` → Waveform screenshot  
   - `README.md` → Block-specific verification summary  

# Note to Recruiters / Engineers

> This repository is a **reflection of structured, verification-oriented learning**, showing the combination of **digital design knowledge**, **systematic verification**, and **daily discipline** — exactly what’s required for **Design Verification roles in companies**.

# Let’s build something amazing!
